# This socket will return a HTML file with Hello World in it.
## How to run
1. Compile the code
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. To clean the compiled file (not necessary)
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
3. Run the code
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

To see if the socket is working or not, go to your browser then type "localhost:8080". If you see a blank page with "Hello World" written on it, then that means that the socket is working fine.
